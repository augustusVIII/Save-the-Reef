# 🌊 Save the Reef  
**Open Source Coral Data Platform**  

---

## 🌍 Overview
**Save the Reef** is an open-source web platform designed to empower divers, researchers, and ocean enthusiasts to contribute to coral reef conservation. By allowing users to **upload geotagged reef images**, the platform builds a community-driven dataset for **real-time reef health monitoring** and **data visualization**.

The project bridges citizen science and marine research through accessible tools and open collaboration.

---

## 🪸 Key Features
- **📸 Image Upload & Geotagging:** Divers and volunteers can submit coral images tagged with GPS metadata.  
- **📊 Reef Health Dashboard:** An interactive dashboard displaying coral bleaching trends, temperature data, and biodiversity indexes.  
- **🤝 Community Integration:** Open collaboration with NGOs, schools, and research centers through shared data access.  
- **🌐 API Support:** RESTful API endpoints for developers and marine scientists to query, analyze, and visualize reef data.  
- **🧠 Smart Insights (Future Roadmap):** Integrate AI-based image recognition to classify coral species and detect early signs of bleaching.

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview
1. **Frontend (React + Tailwind)** – Handles image upload, geotag extraction, and dashboard visualization.  
2. **Backend (Express + Flask)** – Stores user submissions, processes metadata, and exposes reef data via REST API.  
3. **Database (PostGIS)** – Stores spatial reef data for map rendering and geospatial analysis.  
4. **AI Module (Planned)** – Future integration for automatic coral classification using TensorFlow.

## 📈 Future Roadmap
- [x] AI model for coral species classification  
- [ ] Global heatmap visualization  
- [ ] Integration with more Marine NGO datasets  
- [ ] Mobile app version for divers  

---

## 🌱 Impact
By creating a shared platform for coral data, **Save the Reef** aims to make reef health monitoring **transparent**, **collaborative**, and **scalable**—turning local diving experiences into global action for ocean conservation.
